    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Many people get hooked on Vietnamese food after trying pho — a heady
        bowl of spiced broth with flat, tangly rice noodles, a featured protein
        topping of your choice, green onions, and herbs. Each pho cook has their
        own formula for seasoning and crafting the broth and toppings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diners get to personalize their pho noodle soup at the table by adding
        various kinds of condiments, herbs, and sometimes bean sprouts too. It’s
        a quintessential have-it-your-way dish. Beef pho (pho bo) is most common
        but there are many kinds of pho.

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Beef bones and tough beef cuts</li>
      <li>Flat rice noodles</li>
      <li>Aromatics</li>
      <li>Salt, sugar, and fish sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1
        teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat
        and simmer broth for about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and
        preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook
        under the preheated broiler, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are
        charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and
        slice ginger; set aside separately.
      </li>
