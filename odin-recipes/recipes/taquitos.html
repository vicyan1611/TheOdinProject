    <h2>Description</h2>

        We are surrounded by so much amazing, authentic Mexican food here in
        Arizona that it has become it is own food group in my diet! I am
        particularly in love with taquitos (often called rolled tacos). They are
        authentically served with guacamole and melted cheese on top, sometimes
        finely chopped lettuce and a drizzle of sour cream as well. And do not
        forget a side of hot sauce or salsa!

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped cremini mushrooms</li>
      <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet heat over medium heat.
        Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion; cook until tender, stirring
        occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add kale. Cook and stir until wilted,
        about 1 minute. Remove from skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup filling; roll up as tightly as
        possible. Arrange taquitos, seam side down, on the prepared baking
        sheet, leaving space between each. Brush evenly with remaining 3
        teaspoons oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until evenly browned and crispy, about 15
        minutes or. Serve with salsa and, if desired, toppers.
      </li>
    </ol>
