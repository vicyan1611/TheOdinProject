        20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our
        top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more
        than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular
        lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John
        unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old â€” read all about his life and
        legacy here.
